# 196. Delete Duplicate Emails

Write an SQL query to delete all the duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest `id`. Note that you are supposed to write a `DELETE` statement and not a `SELECT` one.

After running your script, the answer shown is the `Person` table. The driver will first compile and run your piece of code and then show the `Person` table. The final order of the `Person` table does not matter.



```python
DELETE p1 
FROM Person p1, Person p2
WHERE p1.email = p2.email AND p1.id > p2.id # email 주소가 같은 id를 비교해서 id가 큰 데이터 삭제
```

# 627. Swap Salary

Write an SQL query to swap all `'f'` and `'m'` values (i.e., change all `'f'` values to `'m'` and vice versa) with a single update statement and no intermediate temporary tables.

Note that you must write a single update statement, do not write any select statement for this problem.


```python
UPDATE salary
SET
    sex = CASE sex
        WHEN 'm' THEN 'f'
        ELSE 'm'
    END
```

# 1795. Rearrange Products Table

Write an SQL query to rearrange the `Products` table so that each row has `(product_id, store, price)`. If a product is not available in a store, do not include a row with that `product_id` and `store` combination in the result table.

Return the result table in any order.


```python
'''
PIVOT, UNPIVOT 공부하고 다시 풀기!

SELECT 집계함수의 열 + 기준열의 값
FROM (
    SELECT 원본테이블
) AS TEMP
PIVOT (
    집계함수 FOR 기준열 IN (기준열의 값)
) AS PVT
'''
```




    '\nPIVOT, UNPIVOT 공부하고 다시 풀기!\n\nSELECT 집계함수의 열 + 기준열의 값\nFROM (\n    SELECT 원본테이블\n) AS TEMP\nPIVOT (\n    집계함수 FOR 기준열 IN (기준열의 값)\n) AS PVT\n'



# 180. Consecutive Numbers

Write an SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in any order.


```python
SELECT DISTINCT(l3.Num) ConsecutiveNums
FROM
    Logs l1,
    Logs l2,
    Logs l3
WHERE
    l1.Id = l2.Id - 1
    AND l2.Id = l3.Id - 1
    AND l1.Num = l2.Num
    AND l2.Num = l3.Num
```

# 184. Department Highest Salary

Write an SQL query to find employees who have the highest salary in each of the departments.

Return the result table in any order.




```python
SELECT D.name Department, E2.name Employee, T2.salary Salary
FROM (SELECT E1.id id, T1.salary salary, T1.departmentId departmentId
        FROM (SELECT departmentId, MAX(salary) salary
            FROM Employee
            GROUP BY 1) T1, Employee E1
        WHERE T1.departmentId = E1.departmentId) T2, Employee E2, Department D
WHERE T2.id = E2.id AND
        T2.salary = E2.salary AND
        T2.departmentId = D.id
```

# 1158. Market Analysis I

Write an SQL query to find for each user, the join date and the number of orders they made as a buyer in `2019`.

Return the result table in any order.


```python
SELECT U.user_id buyer_id, U.join_date join_date, IFNULL(T.cnt, 0) orders_in_2019
FROM 
Users U LEFT JOIN
(SELECT buyer_id, COUNT(order_id) cnt
    FROM Orders
    WHERE '2018-12-31' < order_date AND '2020-01-01' > order_date
    GROUP BY 1) T
ON U.user_id = T.buyer_id
```

# 1393. Capital Gain/Loss

Write an SQL query to report the Capital gain/loss for each stock.

The Capital gain/loss of a stock is the total gain or loss after buying and selling the stock one or many times.

Return the result table in any order.




```python
SELECT stock_name, SUM(n_price) capital_gain_loss
FROM (SELECT stock_name,
            CASE 
                WHEN operation = 'Buy' THEN price * (-1)
                ELSE price
            END n_price
        FROM Stocks) T
GROUP BY 1
```
