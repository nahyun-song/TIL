# 185. Department Top Three Salaries

A company's executives are interested in seeing who earns the most money in each of the company's departments. A high earner in a department is an employee who has a salary in the top three unique salaries for that department.

Write an SQL query to find the employees who are high earners in each of the departments.

Return the result table in any order.


```python
SELECT D.name Department, T.name Employee, T.salary Salary
FROM (SELECT *, 
        DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY departmentId ORDER BY salary DESC) rnk
        FROM Employee) T LEFT JOIN Department D ON T.departmentId = D.id
WHERE T.rnk < 4
```

# 262. Trips and Users

The cancellation rate is computed by dividing the number of canceled (by client or driver) requests with unbanned users by the total number of requests with unbanned users on that day.

Write a SQL query to find the cancellation rate of requests with unbanned users (both client and driver must not be banned) each day between `"2013-10-01"` and `"2013-10-03"`. Round `Cancellation Rate` to two decimal points.

Return the result table in any order.


```python
SELECT A.request_at Day, IFNULL(ROUND(B.cnt/A.cnt, 2), 0) 'Cancellation Rate'
FROM (SELECT request_at, COUNT(status) cnt
        FROM Trips T LEFT JOIN Users U1 ON T.client_id = U1.users_id 
            LEFT JOIN Users U2 ON T.driver_id = U2.users_id
        WHERE U1.banned = 'No' AND U2.banned = 'No'
        GROUP BY 1) A LEFT JOIN 
        (SELECT request_at, COUNT(status) cnt
        FROM Trips T LEFT JOIN Users U1 ON T.client_id = U1.users_id 
            LEFT JOIN Users U2 ON T.driver_id = U2.users_id
        WHERE U1.banned = 'No' AND U2.banned = 'No' AND status <> 'completed'
        GROUP BY 1) B ON A.request_at = B.request_at
WHERE "2013-09-30" < A.request_at AND "2013-10-04" > A.request_at 
```


```python
SELECT request_at Day, 
        ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN T.status = 'completed' THEN 0 ELSE 1 END) / COUNT(*), 2) 'Cancellation Rate'
FROM Trips T INNER JOIN Users U ON T.client_id = U.users_id AND U.banned = 'No'
WHERE T.request_at BETWEEN '2013-10-01' AND '2013-10-03'
GROUP BY 1
```
